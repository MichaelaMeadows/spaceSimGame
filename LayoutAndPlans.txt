This is a description of the program mental model. It also captures thoughts on next steps.


The general control flow is intended to be:
1. The game asks each empire to decide what to do
2. Empires have strategies that they use to generate objectives, and actions to go after them.
3. These actions are performed by bases/units/ships and then we move on and repeat.

Of the above, the strategy layer is the next major objective, but I'm having a hard time deciding on how to value objectives.
It's also hard to write strategies since each base operates independantly, but contributes to an overall strategic objective.



Here is the rough class layout in the folders
Bases: Contains the structures for production and storage.
Commands: These are objects that once created, tell the game how to update a thing.
Components: Base classes for products
Empires: The "player"  entitites
Helpers: Useful functions like computing prices, calcualting distances, etc
Nodes: resource mining locations
Ships: These are intended to be "large" combat ships
Vehicles: semi-mindless automated logistics ships. 
Global / World state maintain stuff.

Notes on how the "engine works"
* I work on a tick system that resets on every 1 minute loop.
* The map is separated into logical array blocks to help with finding relevant entities efficiently.


Thoughts on strategy: (Econ, Research, Military? Does there need to be another theme that will dynamically compete?)
1. Econ start, first staurate mines, then build basic components to hit some threshold. Then consider "other" stuff, wahtever that means.
